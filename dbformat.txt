db file format:

Initially the file will just be an append only log of operations - when loading the file we replay the operations performed to get the state of the DB

Later I will implement paging and B+Tree but for now let's just build something that works

Header:
GStore25\n

Record:
key_len uint16   
val_len  uint16
flags    uint8
key_bytes []byte
value_bytes []byte
